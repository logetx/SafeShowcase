<p align="center"><i>A site example by NullTech</i></p>

## Introduction
Nulltech Security is a showcase site built to allow anyone to see how we *plan*, *design* and *build* a site, web app, or PWA.
This site certainly does not have all the security features for a site that deals with security, so it **should not be used in any real application**, as mentioned above is a showcase site by NullTech.

## What we use
In the creation of this site, we used some of the most beloved frameworks and languages for creating websites, including:
* [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

And for the near future we plan to add more libraries to improve the user experience, such as:
 * [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)
 * Real API showcase
 * Better device support
